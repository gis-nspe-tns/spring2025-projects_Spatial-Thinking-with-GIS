            <p class="card-text">This GIS analysis of notable religious sites extends insights on the historical perspectives of the millions of people that have visited the sites for hundreds of years. By finding the Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI) and analyzing the land cover, the maps develop the identity of the site, its characteristics, and a narrative of the culture of the land. This topographic analysis proves that St. Peter’s Basilica is the most accessible site while the evaluation of Badrinath characterizes it as the most difficult location to reach. Not only does each site hold a valuable cultural context but the surrounding land also has a unique portrayal that informs the identity of these places as spatial and cultural monuments.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Birds' migration patterns have been increasingly affected by night lights and light pollution, as the lights are incredibly disorienting to these migrating birds, as they disrupt circadian rhythms as well as causing collisions and lost birds, as the bright lights attract birds in the wrong directions. Inspired by Audubon's bird migration pattern map, as well as the apparent harmful effects night lights have on migratory birds and our ecosystems, data collection and GIS methodology were utilized to showcase select bird migration patterns and night light data over time in order to display the overlap between these two factors, which in the future could aid in analyzing which species are most at risk and how people can better coexist with the natural environment. Mapping each of these patterns and overlaying them allows us to view how these paths intersect and how we can better coexist with the natural world we are a part of.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Seattle’s homelessness increased significantly within the year 2024. Gathering data through public complaints of unauthorized encampments and illegal dumping to understand the geographies of the unhoused elaborates Seattle’s first four months of 2025’s response to this issue. Utilizing GIS tools to sort through data from January to the end of April to map logged complaints throughout the city involves multi step processes to organize the results that emphasize distributions of data and patterns to properly assess the stasis of homelessness. The two different data sets inform one another to elaborate neighborhood characteristics. Furthering the results, the data is plotted on two separate bar charts visualizing neighborhoods and their respective number of complaints of the variables of unauthorized complaints and illegal dumping to specify a focus on necessary spaces to improve upon. The results show that central neighborhoods and streets to the city’s movement are most affected by these complaints; Downtown and Capitol Hill have significantly high rates of calls, and within Ballard and Beacon Hill interest lies within the visual arrangement as well as the rate in each variable showing distinct differences.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">As the climate continues to warm and sea levels rise, mapping has become a powerful tool for protecting cities like New York from flooding. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) help us identify areas most at risk, model future flood scenarios, and guide smarter urban planning. Historically, NYC was rich in natural habitats and biodiversity, including extensive wetlands that acted as natural barriers against storm surges and coastal flooding. However, due to rapid industrial development, the city has lost over 80% of its original wetlands. This loss has significantly increased flood vulnerability in low-lying neighborhoods such as Red Hook. By using mapping tools, we can visualize target areas for restoration or green infrastructure. Mapping also helps planners and communities make data-driven decisions about where to build, where to protect, and how to adapt. Restoring natural systems and integrating them into urban design is essential for a more resilient and flood-prepared future.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Bolivia has the largest surviving Indigenous population in the Americas, but this population has been rapidly shrinking in recent decades. Indigenous populations that become displaced from their homelands are more likely to stop identifying with their Indigenous ethnicities, communities, and practices. Displacement is caused by a combination of human industrialization that encroaches upon Indigenous territories and intensified climate change. The main factors causing displacement in Bolivia are drought, flooding, deforestation, mining, fossil fuel extraction, and landfills. A risk assessment to determine which Indigenous territories are at the greatest risk of displacement was conducted by quantifying each of these factors. No Indigenous territory received a risk score of 0, indicating no risk of displacement. The territories at greater risk of displacement were located in the grassland and Amazon rainforest regions rather than the Andes Mountains, however due to the large range of factors causing displacement, the risk was widespread and the source of the risk (the main factor resulting in risk of displacement) varied based on the region.</p>
