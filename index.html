            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Using data from the US Census 2020, this project finds patterns in how different age groups choose to travel to work based on their population density. This demographic trend analysis can shed light on accessibility, economic opportunities, and the quality of life of different counties in the United States. Transportation is a vital component to daily life and how people commute to work can greatly affect one’s time, cost, and wellbeing. This question is also related to the larger theme of GIS because it allows for spatial analysis, visualization, and showing patterns in a correlation between infrastructure and age. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">As housing prices in New York City increase, it becomes increasingly popular for those with jobs in the city to live along a commuter train line and pay lower cost-of-living prices. There are a variety of train options available, including the Metro-North Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), and New Jersey Transit. This project evaluates whether the population density of people living in upstate New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey is related to their distance from these train lines. Using QGIS software to map the relationship between population density and public train lines, I ask how population density changes in the New York City metro area based on access to commuter train lines.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project explores the spatial relationship between historical redlining, subway access, and household income in New York City. As a native New Yorker myself I want to take a more critical look at the trains I take everyday and how the intentional choices that went into the subway lines have deeper and more meaningful implications. In many U.S. cities, proximity to public transit—specifically subways—is a critical factor influencing economic mobility, employment access, and community development. At the same time, the legacy of redlining has left lasting marks on the urban landscape, contributing to patterns of racial segregation, disinvestment, and economic disparity that persist today.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Using QGIS was relevant to the goal of this project as overlaying and comparing redlining points with income polygons provides a comprehensive map of how communities have stayed the same and therefore proving the lasting effects of redlining or how neighborhoods have been able to become more affluent over the course of New York’s history. Ulterior reasoning such as the tourism boom to New York after 9/11 is a proposed answer but despite certain special cases, specifically Lower Manhattan, do not negate the ultimate conclusion. Through the course of this investigation the conclusion is drawn that urban infrastructure was created with politically racialized ideas of segregation and purity leading to the underdevelopment of certain parts of the city as evidenced by reduced access to a key public amenity: the subway.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Over 1.3 million New York City residents are over the age of 65. In the past decade, this population has grown by at least 32% in every borough, with Queens seeing the fastest increase. As this age group grows faster than any other, cities must adapt services to support older adults. Rising unaffordability and a warming climate compound these challenges. Extreme heat disproportionately impacts the elderly, especially people of color (NYC.GOV Heat Vulnerability Index). Mobility is essential for healthy aging. Older adults with declining mobility are less likely to live independently and face higher risks of illness, disability, and reduced quality of life (National Institute on Aging). This project addresses the challenge of staying mobile in extreme heat by creating routes between two points that prioritize access to elderly-focused amenities. Using least cost path analysis, I mapped routes with close proximity to benches, air-conditioned spaces, water fountains, and more.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Air pollution caused by fossil fuels is a huge health issue that affects a lot of people on a day to day basis, but a lot of people don’t quite understand how much health issues such as asthma are tied to air pollution. I conducted an analysis of the three primary factors that are at play in this issue across the US: locations of fossil fuel power plants, particulate matter 2.5 rates, and asthma rates. Having a geographic representation of this issue helps to see the connection between fossil fuels and health issues so people can understand how it affects local communities.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">This project sets out to tell the story of a land and the people who’ve historically inhabited it. Palestine has been a territory slowly being colonized and ethnically cleansed since the late 1800’s. I am interested in demonstrating, through mapping, how the Palestinian people have been gradually siloed into smaller and smaller parcels of their ancestral homeland. This project does so through the generation of images which layer historical maps over contemporary ones, using the GIS tool for georeferencing. By doing so, and then creating polygons over the land to demonstrate how borders and territories have changed over time by calculating their square mileage and comparing those polygons across time, a history of dispossession and domination emerges through the sequence of maps.</p>
